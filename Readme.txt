Notes:
	I decided to take a different spin on the assignment and create a system that mimimics that of amazon's 
	"Cart system" as that is what the UML diagrams best described it as for me. 
	In saying this, I decided to opt out of using the discount feature in the sequence diagram and the employee
	object in the class diagram, as they technically speaking are involved, but when working with the system 
	in the format of amazon's cart system they are not so important. 

	I chose to leave out the login area within the UI as it is an unnecessary feature when time is tight. So I 
	left the note there if I ever decide to implement that feature down the road when homework isnt so large.
	
	ENSE470Lab1.java contains my main function. I decieded to showcase my backend in this area for the marker
	to show that it is functional in the event that a failure happens in the UI as it is a newer addition. 
	
	I currently do not have it implemented to allow the user to remove an item from the cart. However, this 
	would be a great addition.
